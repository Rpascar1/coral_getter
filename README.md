# CoralGetter

This program scrapes the website https://tjmcorals.com/ showing current and out stock items as well as price ranges for all stock and items I specificallyt buy which tend to be less than $100. I created this functionality as it does not exist on the actual website currently.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coral_getter'
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coral_getter

And then execute:

    $ bundle

 

## Usage

//use:     ./bin/coral_getter - to  run the program

run this command in the command line if error says you need or do not have permission to execute:

chmod a+x ./bin/coral_getter

This will make the file executable.

Use this app to see in stock sps coral as well as anything under $100

## Development



After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
